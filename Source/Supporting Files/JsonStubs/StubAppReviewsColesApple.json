Turns out no one can get a signal in Bray Park Coles. I would have been better off writing my list as normal and grouping items from what I know. \nSuggestion: if the store has no signal, either allow wifi in store or stop the app from refreshing so it can show my aisles the way I saw them before I got there (otherwise this app is just like any other shopping list app).",

What's annoying is that the app doesn't seem to be able to put all of the items on my list into aisles or categories, especially produce. Some items appear under \"fresh produce\" (as they should) but most of them are at the end of the list under \"aisle unknown\" even bananas! This is not helpful. If the app can't do it automatically, then please give me a manual option, so that I can put items in the right aisle or category myself. I'd also really like to be able to set two stores, instead of switching from one to the other to reset as 'my store.'",
