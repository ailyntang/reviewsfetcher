# Reviews Fetcher #

### Purpose ###

The purpose of this app is to provide a quick overview of the star ratings and reviews of an app that is live in the App Store or Google Play Store.

We anticipate the app will be used primarily for business development and account management. Some examples are:

* **Competitive landscape**: comparison of all the banking apps in Australia

* **Deep dive into one brand**: understand the breadth of apps that one client has, e.g. Woolworths, Medibank, etc.

* **Recently launched apps**: easily keep track of user reviews after an app launch

### Third parties ###

This app uses the App Figures API to collect the data. This is a paid API service.
